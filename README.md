Creating User Stories 

## Reflection
The ERDs I created for the previous assignment are missing some information that could be important to have. I think I missed connecting the diagrams through a relationship, which make them not as useful as they could be. 

## User Stories 
As a student, I want to be able to track what classes are required for my degree, so that I can stay on track for graduation. 

1. As a transfer student, I want to know what classes are transferable, so that I don’t have to take unnecessary classes. 

2. As an advisor, I want to be able to tell students what classes are required for their classes, so that they can register for the right classes on time. 

3. As a transfer student, I want to know what classes are transferable, so that I don’t have to take unnecessary classes. 

4. As a college recruiter, I want to be able to give students detailed degree plans, so that they can make informed decisions about where to attend. 

I feel like these are the main users for the system, students and advisors. I thought a college recruiter might find it handy if it was a more personalized meeting.
